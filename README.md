# 📊 Predictive Analysis of Screen Time in Indian Kids Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the screen time habits of Indian children and predicts excessive screen usage using machine learning techniques.  
The dataset contains survey-based information on children's lifestyle, including **age, gender, sleep duration, outdoor activity, study hours, and social media usage**.  
The goal is to build predictive models and extract meaningful insights that can help **parents, educators, and policymakers** encourage healthy digital habits.

  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` → Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` → Machine learning models  
- **IDE/Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)  

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand kids’ screen habits.  
- Build predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
- Identify the **key lifestyle factors** influencing excessive screen time.  
- Provide **insights and recommendations** for healthier digital balance.

## 🔑 Key Insights
1. Most children spend **3–5 hours daily** on screens, exceeding healthy limits.  
2. Older kids (13–17 years) show higher screen usage compared to younger children.  
3. **Less outdoor activity** strongly correlates with excessive screen time.  
4. Kids with **low sleep (<7 hrs)** generally show higher screen exposure.  
5. **Social media usage** is a major driver of higher screen hours.  
6. **Random Forest** model performed best, highlighting outdoor activity, sleep, and social media as key predictors.

## 📈 Results
- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees  
- **Best Accuracy**: Random Forest,Decision Tree (100%)  
- **Most Important Features**: Screen Hours, Outdoor Activity, Sleep Duration, Social Media Usage  

---

## 🚀 Future Work
- Apply **deep learning models** for better predictions.  
- Collect larger datasets for higher generalization.
